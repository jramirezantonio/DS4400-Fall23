    "GLM extends traditional linear regression to accommodate a broader class of response variables, including binary (yes/no), count (e.g., number of events), and continuous variables. The key idea behind GLM is to link the mean of the response variable to a linear combination of predictor variables through a link function. This allows for modeling relationships in a more flexible and interpretable way, as the choice of link function can be tailored to the nature of the data. \n",

One objective of the study was to determine which characteristics of the female were associated with the number of satellites. Of particular interest is the relationship between the width of the female carapace and satellites. It includes:\n",
